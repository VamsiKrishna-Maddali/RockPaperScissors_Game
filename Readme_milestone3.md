# This is a description for milestone 3 of rock paper and scissors game.

Rock paper and scissors game is designed using python script. The program asks the user's inputs for Rock, paper and Scissors in the form of integers to play against computer's random input obtained using random module and determines who won the game by storing and comparing user and computer inputs. This is similar to the game created in Milestone 1 and can be played only using python script using a function.
